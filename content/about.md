## Hi!

## About Me

I am a Database Administrator at Grupo Ceuma and Co-founder / CTO of Impacto Maker. I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science by Pitágoras College, Technician in programming of Digital Games by UEMANET, member of the community PHP Maranhão and other communities of Technology of the State of Maranhão. I currently work as DBA and Full Stack Developer using mainly PHP and Python. "Flirting" with DevOps, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Development of Digital Games for Education. Passionate about Free and open-source software (FOSS), web technologies, science and innovation.
